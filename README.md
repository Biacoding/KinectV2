# MI12-ANALYSE D’AMBIANCE PAR TRAITEMENT D’IMAGE (KINECT V2) 

## Project Overview

This project is built on top of the official Kinect SDK, adding communication and data processing with mobile devices. It determines which individual is holding the mobile device by comparing the right-hand acceleration of each detected human body and highlights them with a blue marker.

## Key Features

- Integration with the Kinect official SDK, providing depth and pose tracking capabilities.
- Communication and data transfer with mobile devices.
- Determining the person holding the mobile device based on right-hand acceleration analysis.
- Visualizing the identified person holding the mobile device with a blue marker.

## Installation and Configuration

1. Install the Kinect official SDK and ensure that the Kinect device is correctly connected to your computer.
2. Clone or download this project to your local computer.
3. Open the project and perform necessary configurations, including settings for communication with the mobile device.
4. Build and run the project.

## Usage Example

1. After starting the project, it will begin to receive Kinect data.
2. Establish a connection with the project through the mobile application.
3. The project will analyze sensor data and determine the person holding the mobile device.
4. The person holding the mobile device will be highlighted with a blue marker.
